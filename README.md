# Analysis of Student Debt Among-First-Generation College Students

## Overview
This project investigates the disparities in student debt among first-generation college students. It uses statistical analysis to explore how factors such as college locale, median income, and enrollment size impact student debt across different percentiles of first-generation student populations. The analysis is performed using R, with various graphs and statistical methods to support conclusions.

## Key Questions
- How is student debt distributed among first-generation student percentiles?
- What is the correlation between first-generation student percentage and student debt?
- How do median income, enrollment size, and locale affect student debt?
  
## Hypothesis
Significant disparities exist in student debt levels among first-generation students, influenced by multiple factors identifiable through statistical analysis.

## Methodology
The dataset consists of variables like FirstGen, Debt, MedIncome, NetIncome, Enrollment, Locale, and State. The analysis involves data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and graphical representation using R.

## Results
- **Debt Variation**: Debt increases with higher first-generation student percentages.
- **Income Influence**: Higher median income correlates with lower debt levels.
- **Enrollment**: Larger colleges tend to have higher student debt.
- **State-Level Analysis**: Significant variation in debt and first-generation student percentage across states.
